Brainstorm technology: Mass spectrometry

General idea:

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. In simpler terms, a mass spectrum measures the masses within a sample. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry).
The technique can be coupled to many upstream purification platforms (GC-MS, LC-MS and others)

Mechanism:

The molecules that enter the device are ionized and afterwards separated according to their mass/charge ratio. During this process the molecules often break up and the signal of the fragments to be attributed to the original compound.


Output:

The output of an MS analysis is file containing mass/charge values together with the number of their occurences.
