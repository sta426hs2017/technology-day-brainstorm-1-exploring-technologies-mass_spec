### Brainstorm technology: Mass spectrometry

## General idea:

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass/charge ratio. In simpler terms, a mass spectrum measures the masses within a sample. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures >[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry).
The technique can be coupled to many upstream purification platforms like GC-MS, LC-MS and others.

## Mechanism:

The molecules that enter the device are ionized and afterwards separated according to their mass/charge ratio. During this process the molecules often break up into fragments. This process follows known molecular mechanisms, which allows the analyst to reconstruct potential source molecules from the recorded fragments. If proteins are analyzed they are enzymatically digested prior to MS analysis to reduce the complexity of the sample.


## Output:

The output of an MS analysis is a file containing mass/charge values together with the number of their occurences.

## Analysis

* Select a candidate peak for the molecular ion
* Examine spectrum for peak clusters of characteristic isotopic patterns
* Test peak candidate by searching for other peaks correspond to reasonable losses making up for entire atoms or molecule fragments
* Look for characteristic low-mass fragment ions
* Compare spectrum to reference spectra, e.g.: [libraries](http://chemdata.nist.gov/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chemdata:start#libraries)
* In the case of protein samples: use algorithms to stitch together peptide sequences based on the linked amino acid that were observed.
